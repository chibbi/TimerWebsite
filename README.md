<h1> Website with Timers </h1>
<p><strong>maintained</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Why</strong>
  <br>
  This project originated from me wanting to have an overview how much time i have left for my final exams.
  After those, i realised, that the website would be far more helpful if other people could add their own timers too.
  <br>
   <br>
  <strong>What</strong>
  <br>
  Now this is implemented, and because i use github-pages as my hosting provider, all of the information about the timers is saved locally.
  This is an advantage in terms of security and privacy, but it is a disadvantage in terms of usefulness, because if it was not completly locally,
  i could create a timer on my phone and look at it on my computer. This is currently not possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Future Plans</strong>
  <br>
  i may add the possibility to sync devices, but this was (and still is) supposed to be a very simple small project.
  Syncing devices would not fit in the premise of being small and simple, but if i have too much free time, i may add that functionality.
